# Noise Pollution Monitoring System

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Noise Pollution Monitoring System. The system is designed to measure and assess the levels of unwanted or harmful noise in a particular environment, contributing to environmental monitoring and public health efforts.

## Key Features

- **Noise Measurement:** Utilizes sound level meters and noise dosimeters to measure noise levels in decibels (dB) and capture data on noise intensity, frequency, and duration.

- **Source Identification:** Identifies and characterizes sources of noise pollution, such as transportation, industrial activities, construction sites, and more.

- **Regulation Compliance:** Ensures compliance with regional noise standards and regulations, assessing whether noise levels are within acceptable limits.

- **Data Analysis:** Analyzes collected noise data to assess its impact on the environment and human health. Calculates metrics like L10 and L50 for noise exposure quantification.

- **Mapping and Visualization:** Visualizes noise pollution data on maps using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify noise hotspots and trends.

- **Community Engagement:** Engages with the community to gather noise complaints and concerns, incorporating citizen science initiatives and resident feedback.

- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluates the impact of excessive noise on human health, wildlife, and ecosystems, addressing issues such as stress, sleep disturbances, and hearing loss.

- **Noise Abatement:** Implements noise mitigation measures, including sound barriers, zoning regulations, noise-reducing technologies, and public awareness campaigns.

- **Long-Term Monitoring:** Tracks noise pollution trends over time to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
